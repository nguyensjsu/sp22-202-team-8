# Yiyang Yin's Project Journal

## Week 1 Scrum Report
1. What tasks did I work on / complete?
I was in charge with the leaderboard element in this game. To make this game a 
more competitive playing experience, we discussed and decided on a easy to show 
leaderboard on both the setting screen and the game ending screen.

2. What am I planning to work on next?
First of all, we need to decide what to put on the backlog task sheet. 
After team discussion, I decided to further work on the tasks regarding the design,
implementation, and documentation of the game’s ending page.

3. What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
We are having difficulties with Scrum practices. For example, although we have put on some backlog items based on our program functionality on our task sheet, we don’t know how to define the tasks for each backlog item so that we can work rather independently without relying on heavy communication. Right now we divide each backlog item into 4 tasks, but that does not look like a good Scrum practice. We need to ask Prof. Nguyen.
I already consulted Prof. Nguyen and have this problem sorted out. For now, I will be in charge of the courage element of
our team, and keep on developing the game screen.


## Week 2 Scrum Report
1. What tasks did I work on / complete?
In this past week, I completed implementation of the leaderboard class, as well as core interactions between counter and other game logic classes.
Right now, the leaderboard object is a part of the game ending screen, showing past high scores aquired on local running environment. It obtains score from the counter object,
and update per cycle when user finishes a game.
2. What am I planning to work on next?
The forth mentioned leaderboard is still extendable. For example, we have two different game modes now, so individual leaderboards are required to track the following scores. Also, since we want to add a function for user to input their info, I need to further modify the leaderboard to integrate the userinfos into coorespoding scores.
A redesign of the leaderboard class singleton pattern is also possible down the road.
3. What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
There are no major blockers, however, I have talked with Joseph to clear some implementation details about the counter class. Since I obtain scores from his work, I need to align some of the get/set methods with him, as well as making sure that I understand the score reset mechanism correctly.
