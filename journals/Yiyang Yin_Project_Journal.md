## Week 1 Scrum Report
1. What tasks did I work on / complete?
I was in charge with the leaderboard element in this game. To make this game a 
more competitive playing experience, we discussed and decided on a easy to show 
leaderboard on both the setting screen and the game ending screen.

2. What am I planning to work on next?
First of all, we need to decide what to put on the backlog task sheet. 
After team discussion, I decided to further work on the tasks regarding the design,
implementation, and documentation of the game’s ending page.

3. What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
We are having difficulties with Scrum practices. For example, although we have put on some backlog items based on our program functionality on our task sheet, we don’t know how to define the tasks for each backlog item so that we can work rather independently without relying on heavy communication. Right now we divide each backlog item into 4 tasks, but that does not look like a good Scrum practice. We need to ask Prof. Nguyen.
I already consulted Prof. Nguyen and have this problem sorted out. For now, I will be in charge of the courage element of
our team, and keep on developing the game screen.
